Version 1.50, 2009-12-07
========================

- Second public release.
- Requires Rails 2.3.5.

TrackRecord is supplied in two versions - one with and one without all required
gems embedded (or "frozen") inside. If you downloaded the version without the
frozen gems, make sure you are running Rails 2.3.5 centrally ("gem update
rails"). You will also need updated versions of gems 'fastercsv', 'ruby-openid'
and 'will_paginate' - see the change details list later on for more details.


Upgrading
---------

To upgrade from an earlier version, shut down your web server and move the
current TrackRecord application directory out of the way. Unpack the 1.5
directory in its place. Copy the database configuration file from the old
installation ('config/database.yml') and re-apply any customisations you
made to the old installation. In particular check the following files:

  config/initializers/email_config.rb
  config/initializers/general_config.rb

Note that the PATH_PREFIX mechanism for running the application in a non-root
location has been removed. Most Rails deployment mechanisms provide a better
way to do this (e.g. see Phusion Passenger). Contact me if you still need this
feature - e-mail "ahodgkin@rowing.org.uk".

You are now ready to migrate your data for the new version. This adds a
'billable' flag to tasks. By default all your tasks will be marked billable.
If more of your tasks are to be marked as not billable instead, change the
migration so it sets the billable flag to 'false'. See the following file:

  db/migrations/017_add_billable_task_flag.rb

Perform a database backup before running the migration so that you can recover
your data if anything goes wrong. Consult your database documentation for
instructions. When ready, start the migration by issuing this command:

  RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate

...from the command line with the current working directory set to somewhere
inside the TrackRecord 1,5 application directory (change "production" to read
"development" or another environment name to run the migration for other
environments, if you need that). You should now be able to restart your web
server and use the upgraded application.


Browsers
--------

This release of TrackRecord has been tested on Firefox 3.5 and Safari 4. For
very best results please use these browsers or a later version of either. Opera
10 has been tested and works well, except for some minor visual degradation due
to use of some non-standard CSS extensions which Opera does not support.

The application should work correctly on older Firefox versions back to version
2.0, the Opera 9 series and WebKit-based browsers such as recent versions of
Konqueror or Google Chrome, though these have not been used for testing.

Although TrackRecord will function under Microsoft Internet Explorer 8, some
functions will not be available and performance will be degraded, with greater
load on the server for some operations. Earlier versions of this browser are
not supported at all.

Browsers without JavaScript support such as NetSurf v2.x should work but, as in
Internet Explorer 8, some functions will not be available and greater load will
be placed on the web server for some operations.


Changes from version 1.0
------------------------

- The following new gems are now required:
  + Gem: calendar_date_select 1.15 (replaces plugin used in TrackRecord v1.0)
    ("gem install calendar_date_select" or "rake gems:install").
      http://code.google.com/p/calendardateselect/
      http://github.com/timcharper/calendar_date_select

- The following new gem versions are needed:
  + fastercsv 1.5.0
      http://fastercsv.rubyforge.org/
  + ruby-openid 2.1.17
      http://openidenabled.com/ruby-openid/
      http://github.com/pelle/ruby-openid
  + will_paginate (formerly called "mislav-will_paginate") 2.3.11
      http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate

- The following plugins have been updated:
  + acts_as_audited 2009-01-27
      http://github.com/collectiveidea/acts_as_audited
  + open_id_authentication 2009-10-21
      http://github.com/rails/open_id_authentication
  + safe_in_place_editing 0.02 23-Oct-2009 - custom plugin; provides in-place
    editing features without XSS vulnerabilities present in earlier Rails
    releases and with some extra facilities not available in the current
    Rails release at the time of writing. Currently only available as part of
    TrackRecord.

- The following plugins have been removed:
  + calendar_date_select (is now a gem, see above)
  + scope-out (application now uses Rails' named_scope)
      http://code.google.com/p/scope-out-rails/

- The following new plugins have been added:
  + quiet_leightbox - custom plugin; only include Leightbox components if the
    view requires it. Currently only available as part of TrackRecord.
  + quiet_prototype - custom plugin; only include Prototype and Scriptalicious
    components if the view requires it. Currently only available as part of
    TrackRecord.
  + yui_tree - custom plugin; support the YUI tree component. Currently only
    available as part of TrackRecord.

- The following third party JavaScript components have been updated:
  + Prototype 1.6.1
      http://www.prototypejs.org/
  + Scriptalicious 1.8.3
      http://script.aculo.us/

- The following new third party scripts have been added:
  + builder.js from Scriptalicious 1.8.3
      http://script.aculo.us/
  + leightbox.js (21/2/2006)
      http://www.eight.nl/static/files/leightbox/
  + YUI tree resources are in 'public/yui' and come from the YUI library 2.7.0
      http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/

- The following scripts have moved:
  + safe_in_place_editing.js is now installed in an eponymous subdirectory.
  + TrackRecord custom scripts are now also in an eponymous subdirectory (see
    'check_box_toggler.js', 'section_revealer.js' and 'timesheet_editor.js').

- The following scripts are removed:
  + dynamic_task_list.js (replaced by YUI tree)

- Files 'config/initializers/acquire_fastercsv.rb' and 'acquire_paginator.rb'
  removed as the list of gem versions in 'config/environment.rb' does their
  job; application controller file 'application.rb' now called
  'application_controller.rb'.

- Streamlined sign-in process - users are taken to the log in page straight
  away, without a pointless click-through Home page. Help text on the sign
  in page is hidden behind a show/hide panel to keep the page simple.

- Added notion of billable and non-billable tasks. Tasks are considered
  billable by default.

- Numerous improvements to the report generator:
  + Report on active, inactive, billable and non-billable tasks.
  + Custom task sorting and grouping in the final report.
  + Hide rows or columns which add up to zero hours.
  + Improved date menu selectors which reflect the precise range of actual
    work packets in the database, rather than rounding to a whole year.
  + Extra columns in CSV output to aid further processing (e.g. task and
    project code information).

- Improvements to the bulk task importer:
  + JS toggle switches to select all, deselect all or invert the selection
    of tasks for import.
  + Grouped display of tasks and control over collapsing tasks into their
    parent groups, for cases where an XML project file describes a project
    in greater detail than required by the corresponding timesheets.
  + Important bug fix - sometimes task durations could be rounded to
    integer hours when imported.

- Other minor improvements such as:
  + Uses Rails default scoping and named scopes to improve code legibility
    and efficiency throughout.
  + Detects presence of JavaScript when the user logs in, then shows JS or
    non-JS versions of certain pages to lessen database load where possible.
    For example, YUI tree task selectors only fetch the tasks needed to show
    branches opened by the user, while the non-JS task selector menu must
    fetch all tasks from the database to show one huge selection list; this
    is considerably less efficient at the server side.
  + Only includes scripts in the main layout template when they're needed
    via things like the custom "quiet_prototype" plugin.
  + Minor visual tweaks to the navigation bar (now taller) and various other
    CSS modifications, including a minimum page width to stop undesirable
    wrapping of navigation bar items. A print-specific stylesheet should give
    much better results for printed pages if your browser supports it.
  + Timesheet "show" views show section totals as in the "edit" views (needs
    robust JavaScript support in the browser).
  + Administrator user Home pages are now more clear and compact.

- Various bug fixes, most notable of which are:
  + Custom JavaScript task selectors were a little clumsy and had various
    niggles. Replaced the whole thing with a Leightbox popup which shows a
    heavily customised YUI tree for task selection controlled by a custom
    plugin (see 'vendor/plugins/yui_tree').
  + OpenID servers which return via HTTPS should now work (tested with
    openid.org).
  + The name of a user responsible for a change in the audit trail is now
    shown correctly (due to fixes in the updated acts_as_audited plugin).
  + Section revealer script for hidden text in project views, customer views
    and the sign-in page now works with Opera 10.
  + Migration 014 had a flaw; "rake db:migrate" for a clean installation,
    rather than "rake db:schema:load", would have failed. This is now fixed
    and either approach should work fine.
  + Some redundant ActiveScaffold resources from pre-1.0 versions were
    present in the v1.0 release. These were harmless but have all be removed
    now to keep things tidy.

- Unlisted fixes are very minor, such as the correction of typing errors
  for help text in some views.
