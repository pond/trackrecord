Version 2.21, 2013-08-19
========================

Please see version 2.20's change information below for details. In
particular, please check the database/PostgreSQL notes therein.

Version 2.20 fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.20:

- Fixed a helper call-through usage bug in ReportsController that
  showed up in a live deployment. With every new release,
  https://github.com/pond/trackrecord/issues/6 becomes more urgent.

- Satisfactory reports performance in that context, thus reduced
  production application log level down to normal (not really a bug
  so much as an in-passing note!).


Version 2.20, 2013-08-16
========================

Please see the version 2.11 change details later in this file for very
important details about upgrading from an earlier version or installing
anew. If you're already running version 2.11, there are few extra steps
to take - just update your TrackRecord files with the new release. You
then need to run "bundle install" to get updated required gems.

THIS RELEASE WORKS BEST ON POSTGRESQL. If you are using another
database, please see the HTML documentation in "doc/app/index.html" for
details about other database configurations. TrackRecord should work on
other databases, but report performance will be poor.

Version 2.20 fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.11:

- The report generator was often slower than v2.04, which it was supposed
  to improve upon. The new report generator is much faster than both in
  all circumstances.
  
  THE TrackRecordReprot API HAS NECESSARILY CHANGED AS A RESULT - just
  after I'd said it would be stable for report generators...! Hopefully
  the v2.10/v2.11 series were sufficiently short lived that nobody wrote
  code against that API. There was no other way to improve performance.

  The TrackRecordSection API has changed too. See "doc/app/index.html"
  for API documentation.

  This complete rewrite of the report engine leads to the version number
  bump to v2.20. There are no database changes or migrations, so if you
  are nervous about the changes, you can always roll back the
  TrackRecord files via e.g. Git.

- The "copy report" feature now actually copies reports (!).

- The list of saved reports uses the correct user ID for URLs in the view
  (a technical level fix that users shouldn't notice much).

The only user-facing enhancements are the performance improvements
described above.


Version 2.11, 2013-08-05
========================

The procedure to upgrade from any v2.x release or to install anew is the
same, though upgraders may already have completed some steps:

- INSTALLING:
  If you are not using 'rvm' to manage your Ruby environment, I strongly
  recommend getting that set up, though it's not essential. See:

    https://rvm.io

- INSTALLING:
  If you haven't already, copy "config/database_blank.yml" as
  "config/database.yml" and fill in the details for your database.
  TrackRecord is tested on PostgreSQL 8 though others should work too.

    http://www.postgresql.org

- FOR UPGRADING OR INSTALLING v2.11:
  Update config/production.rb with a path prefix if necessary. This step
  is required because of a very long standing Rails bug.

  See the comments above the "config.relative_url_root" line for details.
  This is vital for anyone running TrackRecord in a non-root location,
  even if you use something like Phusion Passenger and normally expect
  to need no such configuration changes.

    https://www.phusionpassenger.com

- FOR UPGRADING OR INSTALLING v2.11:
  Set up, or update your gem bundle, make sure your database is up to
  date and make sure all the static assets (stylesheets etc.) are
  precompiled fully:

    bundle install
    RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
    RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:clean
    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile

Please do all of the upgrade steps if running any version 2 release prior
to v2.11. If upgrading from version 1, please see the version 2.00 change
log details towards the end of this file.

Version 2.11 of TrackRecord fixes issues with the asset pipeline
migration introduced in version 2.10 and clears up documentation to make
installing and upgrading easier. There are no other changes or fixes.


Version 2.10, 2013-08-02
========================

Please see the version 2.00 notes later for information about updating
from version 1. You will need to migrate your data to upgrade from any
previous v2.x release; for example, to migrate the production database,
run this command:

  RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate

Use of the Rails asset pipeline and updated gems, including Rails 3.2.14,
mean you will also need to update your Gem bundle and precompile assets
for production:

  bundle install
  RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile

This can be a fraught process and the best I can do is recommend you do
web searches for any of the huge range of problems this process seems
prone to throwing up; but with luck, it'll just work. IMPORTANT: If you
run the application from a subdirectory rather than the root of your
domain, even if it's done transparently with Passenger, you have to take
extra steps. See after the change details below for more.

Version 2.10 fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.04:

- Errors made in a timesheet editor grid (e.g. non-numerical hours) would
  cause validation to fail correctly, but changes made elsewhere would be
  reset when the form was presented back with errors listed. Changes to
  the timesheet's week, description and/or commit flag are now maintained.

- Sign-in page updated with new text, fixing outdated links.

- A few minor comment typing errors fixed, some HTML validation fixes,
  further improvements to internationalisation.

- The prototype.js library version is updated to version 1.7.1 (with a
  very large number of alterations despite the minor version change).

- Moved to using the Rails 3 asset pipeline and fixed up issue related to
  this in various plugins. This is a relatively significant change to the
  internal organisation of the software and is the main reason for the
  TrackRecord version number jump.  

There are the following enhancements:

- Added "relative week" and "relative month" report ranges. You can
  now for example set a report to work for "last month" and whenever
  it is generated, an appropriate time range is chosen. To support
  this and additional new options, the report editor page has been
  redesigned, hopefully making it easier and faster to use.

- Added a comprehensive report type. This is similar to the by-task
  standard report, but adds user breakdowns showing the contribution of
  selected users to the total hours for each task at each column of the
  report. This is in addition to the by-task and user summary reports.

- Saved reports can now be copied, thus acting as report templates.

- Extensible report generator mechanism. CSV export now runs as a plugin,
  allowing other report manipulation and export mechanisms to be added
  easily by third parties.

- Inline project creation for bulk task import - users reported often
  going through the import process only to realise that they hadn't added
  a project to contain the new tasks. Now both can be done simultaneously.

- Administrators can now bulk-commit timesheets over a given date range.

- Efficiency improvements by using ActiveRecord::Relation better, avoiding
  loading objects into RAM where possible, doing more in the database and
  less inside Ruby code.


Deploying in a subdirectory
---------------------------

Rails asset precompilation is somewhat broken in that it doesn't understand
applications deployed into subdirectories. If you are not using Heroku, you
can fix this by adding the following into config/environments/production.rb:

  config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = true
  config.relative_url_root = '/<your-app-subdir>'

...then precompile the assets. If already compiled, delete the folder
'public/assets' then precompile again (see earlier for the command).

On Heroku, the 'initialize' flag must be 'false'. The following link may
provide some insight about what to do:

  https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/8941

I apologise for the inconvenience, but I can't do much about a bug like
this that's been in Rails for at least two years, especially now that (at
the time of writing) Rails 4 is out so a Rails 3 fix is even more unlikely.



Version 2.04, 2013-07-11
========================

Please see the version 2.00 notes later for information about updating from
version 1. If upgrading from an earlier version 2, you will need to migrate
your data; for example, to migrate the production database, run this
command:

  RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate

Version 2.04 fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.03:

- Sometimes sorting a timesheet's rows would not fully sort them - you would
  have to sort a second time to get the correct result.

- Reordered timesheet rows were not maintained when the timesheet was saved
  and used as a template for another week; the row order would be reset.

There are the following enhancements:

- Timesheets can now be set to auto-sort their contents when rows are
  added or removed.

- Report titles, if set, are included in all report output for easier
  identification.



Version 2.02 and 2.03, 2013-04-25
=================================

Please see the version 2.00 notes later for information about updating from
earlier versions.

Version 2.02 fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.01:

- Saved reports can now be deleted. Related code tidied up in a few other
  places too.

Version 2.03 fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.02 on a live
deployment, rather than with test data only:

- Sometimes duplicating a timesheet would keep apparently duplicating one
  or more of its rows more than once. This was actually due to an
  iterator removing a new timesheet's default rows, as specified in the
  user's control panel, failing to actually iterate over all objects. It
  seems an explicit call to "all" is required on associated collections
  before "each" to reliably iterate across all objects (!). A lot of
  other files have been updated as a precaution, following the same
  pattern.

- In passing while testing this fix, noticed that attribute protection
  code in the Project model was nonsense (copy and paste error); also,
  the custom initializer override parameters at creation, which were
  only subsequently correctable by editing the instance. This fault was
  replicated in Task, Project, User and Customer models; fixed in all.



Version 2.01, 2013-04-09
========================

Please see the version 2.00 notes later for information about updating from
earlier version.

This release fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.00:

- Rails 3 converts dates to dates-with-time-and-timezone using the server's
  local timezone rather than UTC as in Rails 2. This could lead to work
  packets and timesheets having incorrect cached date-time values. Editing
  timesheets would show no issues but reports might be wrong. Noticed on
  the Endurance installation when the server automatically changed from
  UTC to UTC+1 on April 1st. Fixed.

- Administrator users were unable to show saved reports from other users
  unless they were shared, even though they could edit them. Administrators
  can now see all reports.

- Date-based searching in "Manage Timesheets" was broken. Now fixed.



Version 2.00, 2013-03-27
========================

Important
---------

TrackRecord now requires Rails 3.2. It does not run on Rails 2. As a result,
the Ruby version requirements are increased too; you need version 1.9.3 at
patch 392 or later. The upgrade instructions below assume that this is
already available.

On the client side, TrackRecord's views now assume a competent HTML 5, CSS 2
capable browser is used. It looks best on modern CSS 3 aware browsers such as
recent Safari, Chrome, Opera and Firefox builds. JavaScript is very strongly
recommended but not required, so if you have it turned off in your browser
for any reason or your browser doesn't support it, TrackRecord can still be
used. Internet Explorer is untested and not officially supported at any
version, though it may work in practice.


Upgrading
---------

To upgrade, first do a full database backup in case anything goes wrong!
Next, unpack TrackRecord somewhere new - don't copy it on top of an existing
installation. Make any configuration changes you made to your old copy:

- You can safely just copy over the old 'config/database.yml'
- ...and 'config/initializers/email_config.rb'
- ...and 'config/initializers/general_config.rb' files

- Possibly port over your e-mail sending configuration for ActionMailer
  in 'config/environments/production.rb' or '...development.rb' - see:
  http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-configuration

You must also set a secret key in 'config/initializers/secret_token.rb';
this is the equivalent of the key that in previous versions lived inside
'config/environment.rb'. Comments in the file give detailed instructions.

The gem dependencies for TrackRecord are all listed in 'Gemfile'. To get
these installed, from inside the 'trackrecord' directory (the same directory
as this change log file and 'Gemfile'), run:

  bundle install

...to make sure all the relevant gems required by the updated TrackRecord
are present. Now make sure your web server is offline and bring your database
up to date (changing 'production' to 'development' if being rightly cautious
and testing on a development copy first):

  rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

Then you should be able to start your web server again. There may be some
server changes needed for Rails 3; consult your web server documentation if
necessary. I recommend using Phusion Passenger, if possible, to serve Rails
application such as TrackRecord.

If you have trouble running 'bundle' or the migration, in the first
instance check Google for the error message you see - upgrading Rails and
using bundles is very rarely a pain-free process and the issues will usually
be to do with your computing environment rather than TrackRecord's own code.


Changes from version 1.54 (see the v1.x branch for more v1.x changes)
-------------------------

- New major version number reflects bump to Rails 3.2 / Ruby 1.9.
  + Functionality is an evolution and refinement over TrackRecord v1.x,
    rather than a major overhaul.

- Improved navigation flow throughout.
  + More consistent and logical navigation options in some places.
  + Updated visual theme makes things easier to read.

- Reports can be saved for recollection and modification later.
  + Can be kept private or shared to other TrackRecord users.
  + Sharing URLs are very simple, since they just refer to a saved.
    database object rather than recording all report parameters.
  + Old-style long report URLs from TrackRecord v1.5 are supported and
    create a temporary user report.
  + Quick report generation buttons available when managing or viewing
    customers, projects, tasks and users.

- All list search forms extended to at long last support date ranges.

- Improved labels for customers, projects and tasks everywhere - link back
  to the original item, with tooltips giving code and description details.

- The beginnings of proper internationalisation are in place, though a lot
  of messages are not yet run through the language files.

- The 'gruff' gem is commented out inside 'Gemfile' to prevent annoying
  dependencies. The graph controller mechanism is still present but will
  not work unless you uncomment the gruff line in 'Gemfile' and re-run
  "bundle install". It isn't used by default anywhere in TrackRecord.

- Bugs related to tasks with no project or projects with on customer fixed.

- Old-style report URLs are now reliable, rather than leading to 404 errors
  on older TrackRecord versions if active tasks had become inactive or vice
  versa. Now the active-vs-inactive lists are reassessed at generation time
  (and the signed in user's task permissions taken into account as usual).
