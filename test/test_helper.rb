# around this. Have the test helper herein ensure that's done, else
# the suite would start to run OK but then fail badly later.

# TL;DR wish I'd learned RSpec back before I wrote everything with

  # The use of Poltergeist / PhantomJS means that threading issues cause
  # changes within transactions not to be "seen" by the testing code, so
  # some tests fail (for example, deleting all users, then visiting the
  # signup page to verify that you got the first-time-signup view, would
  # not work). We use Database Cleaner for integration tests to solve this,

  # any integration test, JavaScript is disabled. After each test is run,
  # JavaScript is automatically disabled again.

  # Remember, tests running with JavaScript enabled require Database Cleaner
  # and due to the large data set used for testing, this is extremely slow.
  # Since the delays are at startup/teardown, one mitigation strategy is to
  # simply write as much as possible in a very large single test, but this
  # has obvious drawbacks. Another might be to manually call
  # "thelper_disable_database_cleaner()" after enabling JavaScript, but only
  # if you know that your test makes no local database changes at all - the
  # in-database changes can occur via simulated web page actions only.
