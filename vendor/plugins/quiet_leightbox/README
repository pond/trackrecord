QuietLightbox
=============

Makes it easy to include Leightbox only when you want it while still having
an application-global layout. That is, rather than using something like the
following in a "layouts/application.html.erb" file:

  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'leightbox/leightbox' %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag    'leightbox/leightbox' %>

...you instead do something like this:

  <%= include_leightbox_if_used %>

...and JS plus CSS links will only be output if a Controller handling the
current action has said that it wants Leightbox facilities for that action's
view by making a call along the lines of:

  uses_leightbox()

...around the same place it might declare "before_filter" items and the like.
The "uses_leightbox" method takes a hash of options which are passed straight
through to the Rails "before_filter" API allowing the Controller to further
refine its use of Leightbox to certain views, for example, to use Leightbox
in an "edit" action (and in a related "update" action in case an update fails
and re-renders the "edit" view):

  uses_leightbox( :only => [ :edit, :update ] )

If you also use the "quiet_prototype" plugin, then note that you should not use
both "uses_prototype" and "uses_leightbox" for the same actions in the same
controller. Since Leightbox depends on Prototype, the default set of JS
inclusions will be used for Leightbox. Calling "uses_prototype" as well as
"uses_leightbox" will result in the same JS and CSS being included twice.

This plugin does not include Leightbox components for installation. Download
these and install them per your specific requirements. At the time of writing,
Leightbox is available from:

  http://www.eight.nl/static/files/leightbox/

Copy "scripts/lightbox.js" into the public Javascript folder, as "leightbox.js"
inside a folder "leightbox.js" (hence, "javascripts/leightbox/leightbox.js").
Similarly, copy the stylesheet as "leightbox/leightbox.css" into the public
stylesheets folder.


Useful patch
============

To allow ESCape to close a Leightbox popup, modify the Leightbox JS file as
follows.

* Add this in the "initialize" function (anywhere will do);

		this.keyHandler = this.deactivateKey.bindAsEventListener(this);

* In the "displayLightbox" function, replace this single line:

		if(display != 'none') this.actions();

  ...with this set of lines:

		if(display != 'none'){
		  this.actions();
		  Event.observe(window, 'keydown', this.keyHandler);
	  }else{
		  Event.stopObserving(window, 'keydown', this.keyHandler);
    }

* Finally, add this new function somewhere in the class definition - e.g. just
  above the definition of "deactivate":

	deactivateKey: function(event){
		if (event.keyCode == 27){
			this.deactivate();
			Event.stop(event);
		}
	},

  Note the trailing comma at the end of the function definition which is
  required if another item definition follows (JavaScript required syntax).


Heritage
========

The plugin wrapper concept comes from larsklevan's "yui_editor" plugin:

  http://github.com/larsklevan/yui_editor/tree/master

The QuietLeightbox plugin would not exist without this component. My thanks
go to the author for his hard work.


Installation
============

script/plugin install [TBD]
