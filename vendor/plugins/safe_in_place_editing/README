==================                                         ================

The stock InPlaceEditing plug-in code is inadequate for a few reasons
documented below. This compelled me to write a replacement. For all of
the shortcomings I may perceive in the InPlaceEditing plug-in, though,
this plug-in would not exist without the original, from which it
borrows very heavily. My thanks to all involved.

This variant attempts to fix the problems described below.


1) InPlaceEditing introduces an XSS vulnerability
-------------------------------------------------

One call to in_place_editor_field and you've just introduced an XSS
security vulnerability into your site. The implementation calls an
undocumented internal Rails interface to put the field value into the
page in the first place, which does not use ERB::Util::html_escape to do
so. The in-place editor JS does NOT (contrary to its documentation) strip
HTML on entered values and the helper method "in_place_edit_for" builds a
Controller method which updates the field and renders its new value again
with no escaping. One can easily enter arbitrary JavaScript and have it
executed. It's practically your very own JavaScript console for each
in-place editor field. Oops.

If we fix the in_place_editor_field code (in passing using a clue from
ActiveScaffold which shows how to write smaller code without using the
undocumented interface) and we update in_place_edit_for to render escaped
text, then we arrive at something like this:

  def in_place_editor_field(...etc...)
    # Get the object's name into 'object_name' and *actual* object into
    # 'object' - this exercise left to reader
    #
    # You might also wish to let the function accept an object name or
    # an object reference as well as being more explicit about the magic
    # instance variable name it assumes if given an object name instead,
    # so that Google doesn't fill up with any more confused people
    # who've been caught out by the rather confusing API.
    #
    column_value = ERB::Util::html_escape(object.send(method))
    tag_options = {:tag => "span", :id =>
        "#{object_name}_#{method}_#{object.id}_in_place_editor", :class
        => "in_place_editor_field"}.merge!(tag_options)
    in_place_editor_options[:url] = in_place_editor_options[:url] ||
        url_for({ :action => "set_#{object_name}_#{method}", :id
        => object.id })
    content_tag(:span, column_value, tag_options) +
        in_place_editor(tag_options[:id], in_place_editor_options)
  end

  def in_place_edit_for(object, attribute, options = {})
    define_method("set_#{object}_#{attribute}") do
      @item = object.to_s.camelize.constantize.find(params[:id])
      @item.update_attribute(attribute, params[:value])
      render :text => ERB::Util::html_escape(@item.send(attribute).to_s)
    end
  end

...but then we encounter more problems:

(1) It's no longer possible to deliberately insert HTML, as per
    documentation examples for Textile and Markaby in-place editors.

(2) The in-place editor form, when shown, shows the *literal* escaped
    text because it uses a "getText" call in the JS domain that reads
    "innerHTML" of the <span> used to mark up the text to be used for
    editing. There are two ways around this:

    * Patch getText to a better implementation as described on the
      scriptalicious Wiki (why is this not in their core release?!)

      http://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/wikis/ajax-inplaceeditor

        Object.extend(Ajax.InPlaceEditor.prototype, {
            getText: function() {
                return this.element.childNodes[0]           ?
                       this.element.childNodes[0].nodeValue : '';
            }
        });

    * Have a custom method to return the unescaped value of the field
      sitting on the server side (again, as for the Textile and Markaby
      examples) - but this means one more controller method and a server
      round-trip each time an editor is shown.

SafeInPlaceEditing patches getText as described above, escapes values in
the initially created form and its auto-generated helpers, if used, escape
updated values when rendering them for the in-place view update. You can
defeat escaping in the safe_in_place_editor_field helper method with a
special override parameter but this is strongly discouraged.

You must include the JavaScript code for the getText patch and supporting
methods:

  <%= javascript_include_tag( "safe_in_place_editing/safe_in_place_editing" ) %>


2) InPlaceEditing bypasses optimistic locking
---------------------------------------------

List views do not hold references to objects so the lock version of an
item with an in-place editor present is not recorded. The update code is
forced to find a new object in the database by ID, so it always operates
on a brand new object. Any changes someone else might have made while the
first user was looking at their in-place editor view will be trampled over.

One might take the approach of the anti-forgery request mechanism patch
needed to get the in-place edit plug-in working with Rails 2, extending
the ":with" key's value in the options hash with a query string passing
the lock_version through:

    if ( object.respond_to?( :lock_version ) )
      in_place_editor_options[ :with ] ||= "Form.serialize(form)"
      in_place_editor_options[ :with ] += " +
          '&lock_version=#{ object.lock_version }'"
    end

The update code on the server side could manually check this against the
object it just found in the database. Unfortunately the form JavaScript
is static, so after a first update the form itself is out of date,
passing an old lock version through so all subsequent update attempts
fail until the whole view is reloaded.

    lock_version = nil
    lock_version = @item.lock_version.to_s if
       (@item.respond_to?(:lock_version))

    if ( lock_version != params[ :lock_version ] )
      # Somebody else already edited this item. Do "something"
      # (see later).
    else
      @item.update_attribute( attribute, params[ :value ] )
    end

We might attempt to write out JS which assigns global variables unique to
each form with the initial lock value. An on-complete JS handler could
then increment the lock version at the client side. But this is
ridiculously complex for the task at hand, requires one to override the
default on-complete handler, bypass or extend the Rails plug-in (since it
offers no interface to change the on-complete handler details) and the
client might still get out of sync with the server's lock versions. Since
there is little alternative, SafeInPlaceEditing takes this approach, using
extra JS support methods to try and reduce the inline code baggage.


3) Error handling seems to be faulty
------------------------------------

In theory, returning a 500 error should lead to the onFailure handler
running in the JS domain, but when used from Rails 2.0.2, the just about
all properties of the 'transport' object used in the default handler
function are undefined. As a result, no alert box can be shown to the user.

The onComplete handler is *always* run, regardless of whether the request
returns a 2xx or other status code. The transport.status value must be
checked carefully by custom handler code. The responseText value is set
correctly for failure cases here, so custom handler code must be used to
report errors as well as handle the "it worked" case. This means custom
JS written out for every single in-line editor field on the page and an
extension to the plug-in since it doesn't expose the onComplete or
onFailure JS options in its API.

The JavaScript assistance functions included with SafeInPlaceEditing take
care of error handling so that if the on-failure code seems to be having
trouble the on-complete code will take over. These functions are also
used to support optimistic locking as described above.


4) It is falling out of date
----------------------------

In-place editing was moved to a plug-in in more recent versions of Rails,
but is has stagnated. It requires a patch just to work with the
anti-request-forgery (CSRF) mechanism of Rails 2. It isn't RESTful. It's
wasteful, requiring multiple near-identical handler methods in the
Controller to deal with field updates.

Some of that's the same with SafeInPlaceEditing. It certainly isn't
RESTful, but it tries to reduce controller bloat a bit and doesn't need
patching for Rails 2. It knows about optimistic locking and takes more
care over security.


Example
=======

See above. See also documentation for the standard InPlaceEditor plug-in.
Sorry, I know, that's lame. Hopefully I'll put something useful in here
sooner rather than later.
