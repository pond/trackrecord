  # Generate a YUI tree task selector. Pass a form builder object in the first
  # parameter (e.g. "bar" in "form_for @foo do | bar |"). The "object_name"
  # field is used to generate a unique ID and name for a hidden element which
  # carries IDs of selected YUI tree nodes, in the form "name[task_ids][]" - as
  # used by non-JS SELECT lists elsewhere. In the form submission processing
  # code, you must handle the use of special IDs in the YUI tree ("P" prefix
  # for Projects, "C" prefix for Customers, no prefix for tasks).
  #
  # In the next parameter optionally pass an options hash with keys and values
  # as shown below; any omitted key/value pair results in the described default
  # value being used instead.
  #
  #   Key              Meaning
  #   =========================================================================
  #   :inactive        If 'true', only inactive tasks, customers and projects
  #                    are shown in the selector. By default, only active items
  #                    will be shown.
  #
  #   :restricted_by   The task/project/customer list for currently logged in
  #                    users who are restricted is always restricted by that
  #                    user's permitted task list no matter what you set here.
  #                    If the current user is privileged, though, then passing
  #                    in a User object results in restriction by that user's
  #                    permitted task list. By default there is no restriction
  #                    so for privileged currently logged in users, all tasks
  #                    would be shown.
  #
  #   :included_tasks  If you know up-front a full list of tasks to show, then
  #                    pass them in here. Only items in the included list will
  #                    be shown. IDs get passed to the XHR handler, among other
  #                    things. This is NOT a security feature - see
  #                    ":restricted_by" for that.
  #
  #   :selected_tasks  An array of tasks to be initially selected in the tree.
  #                    May be empty. By default no tasks are selected. Ideally
  #                    the list should include no tasks that the current user
  #                    or 'restricted_by' key would hide, but if it does, they
  #                    simply won't be shown or selected and only the task IDs
  #                    will appear in HTML output.
  #
  #   :suffix_html     Beneath the text area gadget listing selected tasks is
  #                    a "Change..." link which pops up the Leightbox overlay
  #                    containing the YUI tree. If you want any extra HTML
  #                    inserted directly after the "</a>" of this link but
  #                    before the (hidden) DIV enclosing the tree, use this
  #                    option to include it. To keep things tidy, ensure that
  #                    the string is terminated by a newline ("\n") character.
  #
  #   :change_text     Speaking of the "Change..." link - alter its text with
  #                    this option, or omit for the default "Change..." string.
  #
  #   :params_name     Name to use in params instead of "task_ids", so that
  #                    instead of reading "params[form.object_name][:task_ids]"
  #                    in the controller handling the form submission, you read
  #                    the params entry corresponding to the given name.
  #
  # See also "taskhelp_degrading_selector" for JS/non-JS degrading code.
  #
  # Note that projects with no customer, or tasks with no project will not be
  # shown in the tree; "unassigned" projects and customers are really just an
  # administrative convenience during times when things might be in the
  # process of being reassigned, or right at the start when someone is setting
  # up new tasks, projects and customers, not necessarily starting with the
  # customer definition first.

  # The use cases for task selectors in Track Record are so varied that very
  # specific cases are handled with special-case code and HTML output may
  # include extra text to help the user for certain edge conditions, such as
  # a lack of any available tasks (in a timesheet editor, this may be because
  # all tasks are already added to the timesheet; for a user's choice of the
  # default list of tasks to show in timesheets, this may be because the user
  # has no permission to view any tasks; when configuring the tasks which a
  # restricted user is able to see, this may be because no active tasks exist).
