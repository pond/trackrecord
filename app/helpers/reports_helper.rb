  # Helper class for reporthelp_week_selection and reporthelp_month_selection.
  # Initialize by passing a year for a full set of months, or by passing a
  # year and a range of accurate dates. If the year matches the first or last
  # date in that range, then the months associated with the year will be
  # restricted according to the matching start and/or end date. The range, if
  # given, MUST have a "first" date which is earlier in the year, or at worst
  # the same date as the "last" date (i.e. don't pass in "backwards" ranges).

  # on the previous or next year. If the caller provides a limiting date range
  # that exhibits this (e.g. passes in 31st December 2008, which actually lies
  # in week 1, 2009) then the ReportYear object can do nothing other than
