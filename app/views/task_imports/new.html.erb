          TrackRecord can import data from XML format project management files which
          were created by applications such as OpenProj or Microsoft Project.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any tasks with non-zero work time assigned are included. TrackRecord task
          names are generated from the name of each XML file task, with the name of
          the most immediate grouping parent summary added as a prefix. Assigned work
          time in the XML data is converted to TrackRecord project durations in hours,
          mathematically rounded to two decimal places if need be. Task codes are
          created from the current date and the task ID, this being typically directly
          related to position in which the task is listed in most graphical project
          plan editors. Tasks are imported "flat" since TrackRecord does not support
          hierarchical task structures.
        </p>

        <p>
          To import tasks, choose an XML file stored locally on your computer using
          the button below, then use the "Analyse" button to upload the file. Please
          be patient - XML project files can be very large and may take a while to
          upload and analyse. You can GZip the XML file and upload that instead to
          save on upload time.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          When analysis is complete, a summary of the tasks that have been found will
          be presented, allowing you to control exactly which tasks are imported.
        </p>

        <%= f.file_field 'xmlfile' %>
        <%= f.submit( 'Analyse', { :name => 'import[analyse]', :disable_with => 'Analysing...' } ) %>
