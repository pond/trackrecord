  # Tasks are the fundamental building blocks of a Project. They define
  # specific pieces of work of expected duration, against which work
  # packets are carried out. A WorkPacket object describes an amount of
  # time worked against the project by any User. WorkPacket objects are
  # held within TimesheetRow objects, each related to a specific task.
  #
  # Every Task has an expected duration stored as a number of hours. It
  # is exceptionally common for a task's project and customer (if any)
  # to be looked up, so eager loading those at all times ends up saving
  # on database overhead on average.
