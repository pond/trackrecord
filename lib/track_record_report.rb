require 'track_record_sections'

# A container for report code. TrackRecordReport::Report instances are
# passed to generators - see TrackRecordReportGenerator for details.
#
# A compilable Report sets attributes from parameters passed in, which
# might be the result of a Rails form submission for a potentially new
# or edited SavedReport instance - or more commonly, the "attributes()"
# call result on an existing SavedReport instance. Either way, all the
# attributes are copied internally with extra processing and filtering,
# so you can read things like the saved report "range_start_cache" and
# "range_start_cache" attributes, or instead use the compilable report's
# computed "range" property - a Range instance giving the two inclusive
# Dates for the report start and end.
#
# Once compiled with "compile", a report can be queried by first
# iterating over its rows with "each_row". Discover cells within rows
# with "each_cell_for". If parameters tell the report to include per-user
# data during compilation, then for each row call "each_user_on_row" to
# enumerate users with relevant data on that row, then for each such
# user within the row, "each_cell_for_user_on_row" to enumerate the cells
# giving totals for each user in that row and column (you can also do
# this manually with "each_cell_for" and the Cell "user_total" method).
#
# Ranges of columns for an x-axis-is-date report can be iterated over
# with "each_column_range" and human-readable headings generated using
# "column_heading". Overall totals for all rows can be obtained with the
# "each_column_total" iterator. For each object returned, per-user data
# can be discovered via the "user_total" method if required.
#
# A Report mixes in behaviour from TrackRecordSections so that as well as
# providing report data, it provides section and group information with
# per-section/per-section-per-user calculations all integrated. You can
# use the section interface via the report just as you might use the
# interface directly via TrackRecordSections::Sections.
#
# If you want to get the sorted array of tasks a compiled report covers,
# use the "filtered_tasks" property. To see if a report includes per-user
# details, see if the array in its "users" property is empty. If not, the
# list of users with non-zero totals for a compiled report can be found
# in the "filtered_users" array.
#
# Note that if the "filtered_tasks" array is empty after compilation, the
# report determined that it could perform no useful calculations. Proceed
# as if the report was never compiled in the first place - don't attempt
# to iterate over its rows for example - and just let the user know that
# the report is 'empty' / has no useful data.
#
# A Report itself is a calculation object (see the Calculator and
# CalculatorWithUsers classes) and its own committed and not-committed
# hour values represent the overall report total. The rows and cells and
# various other calculated portions are similarly subclassed. Additonally
# a final pass over the report's non-zero hour tasks is made and three
# numbers generated to indicate overall task results: "total_duration" is
# a BigDecimal giving the total task duration (for tasks with that set),
# "total_actual_remaining" is the total duration minus all committed
# hours (only meaningful if all your reported tasks have valid durations)
# and "total_potential_remaining" further subtracts not-committed hours,
# in timesheets which may yet be edited by their owners - hence it is an
# indication of potential, rather than definite remaining time.
#
# For examples of how all this information can be used, along with where
# precalculated total information is stored and how to generate your own
# totals using report calculator objects yourself, examine the CSV
# export code - see TrackRecordReportGenerator::UkOrgPondCSV inside
# <tt>lib/report_generators/track_record_report_generator_uk_org_pond_csv.rb</tt>.
# You can also consult <tt>app/views/reports</tt> partials for various
# report types, though the mixture of ERb code and HTML therein can make
# it harder to see what's going on.
#
# == Database dependence
#
# For information about this, please see the documentation for
# TrackRecordReport::Report and the FREQUENCY constant.

    #
    # == IMPORTANT! Database dependence
    #
    # <em>Executive summary: Reports are fast on PostgreSQL and slow on
    # anything else, unless you take steps to make sure they run quickly.</em>
    #
    # To run report sums in the database quickly, with minimum queries, the
    # database is asked to group its calculations. When we can group using
    # something that matches the columns of a report, we can get the
    # database to in effect calculate the entire body of the report in one
    # query. So for example, a monthly report would group by year and month
    # number; any given date produces a unique year and month.
    #
    # To do this, the SQL 'EXTRACT' function is used by default.
    #
    # * http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT
    # * http://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_extract.asp
    # * http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions050.htm
    #
    # With the standard report generator implementation, TrackRecord reports
    # rely on being able to extract:
    #
    # * YEAR (must match Ruby Date#year, i.e. numeric, four digit standard calendar year)
    # * QUARTER (must match Ruby Date#quarter, i.e. numeric 1-4, simple 3 full month splits)
    # * MONTH (must match Ruby Date#month, i.e. numeric 1-12)
    # * <em>WEEK - see below - so also ISOYEAR (PostgreSQL v8.3+ specific)</em>
    #   - Ruby mirrors ISOYEAR with Date#cwyear. PostgreSQL v8.3 and later also
    #   provide ISODOW (day-of-week), equivalent to Ruby's Date#cwday, but that
    #   is not needed by TrackRecord.
    #
    # Weekly reports are thorny, because that requires grouping by some idea of
    # a unique numbered week. The commercial week number is the obvious choice.
    # MySQL and PostgreSQL provide a WEEK parameter for this in EXTRACT, but
    # <em>Oracle does not offer this and can't be used</em> without changing the
    # TrackRecord report generator's FREQUENCY constant for weekly reports, or
    # disabling weekly reports entirely.
    #
    # In any case, even that is insufficient. The 31st December 2012 marks the
    # start of commercial week number 1 for the commercial year 2013; but the
    # date itself is in calendar year 2012. January 1st 2006 is actually the
    # last day of commercial week 52 in the commercial year 2005, despite the
    # date being in calendar year 2006. If we were to just use a standard
    # calendar year, we'd get into trouble - 2012 would appear to contain week
    # 1 twice, leading to numbers from entirely different time periods being
    # combined in the report calculations.
    #
    # Thus <em><strong>weekly reports will only function if you use PostgreSQL
    # version 8.3 or later</strong></em> unless you modify the report code.
    # Without modifications, Oracle and MySQL should work (but are not tested).
    # Note that SQLite will <em><strong>not work at all</strong></em> as it has
    # no support for EXTRACT at all - you need to use 'strftime' instead, and
    # this provides easily enough flexibility to support weekly reports too:
    #
    # * http://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html
    # * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9624601/activerecord-find-by-year-day-or-month-on-a-date-field
    #
    # To modify FREQUENCY for a different database:
    #
    # 1. Change "config/initializers/can_database_do_fast_reports.rb" so
    #    that the SLOW_DATABASE_ALTERNATIVE constant value is "false" for
    #    your database. Without this, you won't be able to test your
    #    modifications to FREQUENCY as a "safe mode" fallback is active.
    #
    # 2. Change the ":grouping" key to the equivalent of the EXTRACT already
    #    present, noting that it shoudld always be an array, even if there's
    #    only one group. Ensure that whatever you group by will lead to one
    #    group for every single unique column for the intended report,
    #    e.g. uniquely identifies months across many years, or weeks across
    #    awkward end-of-year boundaries.
    #
    # 3. Change the ":date_to_key" proc so that Ruby generates an array that
    #    matches the grouping keys returned by the database when it runs the
    #    query that calculates the report data. To find out that bit of the
    #    puzzle, search in "lib/track_record_report.rb" (i.e. this file) for
    #    the string "*date_based_key". You'll see a line of code that
    #    assigns this from a variable. Underneath that line, add in:
    #    "raise date_based_key.inspect" and generate a report of the column
    #    duration you are modifying, while in development mode. The raised
    #    exception will show in your browser the form of the value that the
    #    date-to-key proc must return.
    #
    # Also look at the code below the assignment of FREQUENCY to see how the
    # slow "safe mode" is done. You could always create those values inside
    # FREQUENCY by hand for report types you can't generate in the database.
