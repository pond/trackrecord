QuietPrototype
==============

Makes it easy to include Prototype only when you want it while still having
an application-global layout. That is, rather than using the following in a
"layouts/application.html.erb" file:

  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>

...you instead do something like this:

  <%= include_prototype_if_used %>

...and JS links will only be output if a Controller handling the current
action has said that it wants Prototype facilities for that action's view
by making a call along the lines of:

  uses_prototype()

...around the same place it might declare "before_action" items and the like.
The "uses_prototype" method takes a hash of options which are passed straight
through to the Rails "before_action" API allowing the Controller to further
refine its use of Prototype to certain views, for example, to use Prototype in
an "edit" action (and in a related "update" action in case an update fails and
re-renders the "edit" view):

  uses_prototype( :only => [ :edit, :update ] )


Heritage
========

The plugin wrapper concept comes from larsklevan's "yui_editor" plugin:

  http://github.com/larsklevan/yui_editor/tree/master

The QuietPrototype plugin would not exist without this component. My thanks go
to the author for his hard work.


Installation
============

script/plugin install [TBD]
