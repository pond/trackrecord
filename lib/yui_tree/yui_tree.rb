  module ClassMethods

    # Define the "uses_yui_tree" class method, which sets up instance variables
    # "<tt>@yui_tree_options</tt>" and "<tt>@uses_yui_tree</tt>" within any
    # controller calling the method. See "self.included" in the plugin code for
    # more information.
    #
    # The "uses_yui_tree" method can be passed two optional options hashes. The
    # first specifies options for the YUI tree. The second is passed directly
    # to the Rails before_filter[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Filters/ClassMethods.html#M000526]
    # method as filter options and this lets you state conditions for which
    # "uses_yui_tree" applies (e.g. "<tt>:only => ...</tt>" for only certain
    # actions or "<tt>:except => ...</tt>" for all actions except those listed).
    # See the Rails filter API documentation[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Filters/ClassMethods.html]
    # for full details.
    #
    # Most options for YUI trees can be specified in any of three places:
    #
    # 1. In the YAML configuration file.
    # 2. In a call to "uses_yui_tree" from a controller.
    # 3. In a call to the "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree" helper method from
    #    a view.
    #
    # Options in the YAML file are application-global and overriden by those
    # specified in a controller, which are controller-global and in turn
    # overriden by local options given to helper method calls in views.
    #
    # Some options only make sense if specified in the YAML
    # configuration file and so cannot be specified elsewhere. When installed
    # the plugin writes a default configuration file in "config/yui_tree.yml";
    # see this for further information on the option meainings:
    #
    # - <tt>:version</tt>
    # - <tt>:javascript_base_uri</tt>
    # - <tt>:additional_yui_javascripts</tt> (an optional item)
    #
    # The following options usually only make sense if given in the YAML
    # configuration file and have default values written there, but they can
    # be specified per-controller or in each helper call in views if you really
    # want to do that:
    #
    # - <tt>:xhr_timeout</tt>
    # - <tt>:div_class</tt> (the class assigned to any DIV into which a YUI
    #   tree is built)
    #
    # These options can appear in the YAML file or here only, but not in helper
    # calls for individual views:
    #
    # - <tt>:body_class</tt> (a class name added to any existing class name(s)
    #   on the BODY element of the HTML document) - if "<tt>yui-skin-sam</tt>"
    #   is used then CSS files for this skin will be included automatically,
    #   else you must manually ensure that all relevant CSS resources are
    #   included.
    #
    # Other options must be specified in calls to "uses_yui_tree", or to a
    # helper function like "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree" as they have no
    # default values. You could put them into the YAML file but due to the
    # nature of the options it is very likely that you'll specify them in
    # method calls instead. In fact it's more likely that you will want to
    # specify them in calls made in views rather than here in "uses_yui_tree",
    # but you can establish Controller-global defaults by specifying the
    # options here if you find this useful.
    #
    # <tt>:root_model</tt>::
    #   If your model supports tree/nested-set like behaviour - for example,
    #   if your model declares "<tt>acts_as_nested_set</tt>" via the
    #   Awesome Nested Set[http://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set/]
    #   plugin - then specify the root model class here (e.g specify
    #   "<tt>:root_model => Location</tt>" or "<tt>:root_model =>
    #   Category</tt>") as a Controller-global default. Nested set behaviour
    #   assumes a class method called "roots" which takes no parameters and
    #   returns an array of model instances which are tree roots; and an
    #   instance method "leaf?" which also takes no parameters and returns
    #   '<tt>true</tt>' if the instance has no children (is a leaf node),
    #   else returns '<tt>false</tt>'.
    #
    #   The root model is used by YUI tree creation code (e.g. see helper
    #   method "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree") to generate the root data set
    #   for the initial tree view. Alternatively, specify this when you make
    #   the call to e.g. "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree" if you don't want to
    #   set a default here. By default the helper code calls an instance method
    #   called "name" to obtain label text for the tree nodes. Use the
    #   "<tt>:root_title_method</tt>" option (see below) to specify a different
    #   method name if necessary.
    #
    #   The root and child items can be sorted in various ways. See method
    #   "yui_tree_handled_xhr_request?" method for further information.
    #
    #   If you want to supply the collection of root objects yourself, rather
    #   than using a "<tt>:root_model</tt>" (see above) and its "roots" class
    #   method, you can do so when building the tree in a view through a call
    #   to the "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree" helper method. See its
    #   "<tt>:root_collection</tt>" option for details. Whenever you need to
    #   assemble an array of objects to be used as roots or children, you must
    #   always build those objects with the "YuiTree.make_node_object" method.
    #
    # <tt>:root_title_method</tt>::
    #   If using "<tt>:root_model</tt>" (see above) but with a model which uses
    #   something other than a "name" method to return text for showing in tree
    #   nodes, then specify the alternative method's name here as a symbol. It
    #   must be an instance method for the model in question and should return
    #   a non-empty string.
    #
    # <tt>:xhr_url_method</tt>::
    #   Name of a method which will be invoked to get the *prefix* of a URL
    #   used to fetch more tree data (when parent nodes are expanded for the
    #   first time). This is usually a path to a controller's 'index' action,
    #   e.g. "<tt>:locations_path</tt>" or "<tt>:categories_path</tt>". The
    #   corresponding Controller action must return an array of child data. It
    #   can use the "yui_tree_handled_xhr_request?" method to do this
    #   or use entirely custom code. It must return an array of child data as
    #   described above (see "<tt>:root_model</tt>"), generating array entries
    #   with the "YuiTree.make_node_object" method. The parent's database ID is
    #   delivered to the controller action via the "params" hash under key
    #   "<tt>:tree_parent_id</tt>" and may have a string, symbol or integer
    #   value type.
    #
    # Some options are likely to be set per-tree but do have default values:
    #
    # <tt>:select_leaf_only</tt>::
    #     Set to '<tt>true</tt>' if leaves (nodes without children) can be
    #     selected but parents cannot, else '<tt>false</tt>'. Has an internal
    #     default value of '<tt>false</tt>' (i.e. can select anything).
    #
    # A few YUI tree options can be set as global defaults when making calls
    # to "uses_yui_tree", but such defaults only make sense if you use a single
    # tree in any of the containing controller's views. For example, the option
    # giving the ID of enclosing DIV inside which the tree is built falls into
    # this category, since no two elements in a valid HTML document are allowed
    # to have the same ID. It is up to you where you choose to specify these
    # options - here, or individual calls to "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree".
    #
    # <tt>:div_id</tt>::
    #   ID given to the DIV container into which trees are built. Only specify
    #   this as a controller-global default if you are only going to use one
    #   tree control in any given view, else more than one DIV container for
    #   more than one tree view would have the same ID; or make very sure that
    #   any views using more than one tree view specify overriding DIV IDs in
    #   those views' calls to "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree".
    #
    # <tt>:div_class</tt>::
    #   As "<tt>:div_id</tt>", but even less frequently used! Usually you will
    #   want application-wide styles to apply to trees via CSS and thus specify
    #   a single application-global class name in the YUI tree plugin's YAML
    #   configuration file, rather than specifying a controller-global value
    #   here, or even a per-tree value in indivdual calls to
    #   "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree". Nonetheless, the facility exists to
    #   use any of those three approaches should they prove useful to you.
    #
    # <tt>:target_form_field_id</tt>::
    #   Whenever a node is selected, its database ID is written as a value of
    #   the "<tt>value</tt>" (sic.) attribute of the HTML element identified by
    #   this option so that a related form submission will contain the
    #   selected ID. The field is usually a hidden INPUT element.
    #
    #   Although the tree has a multiple selection mode (see the documentation
    #   for "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree" for details), by default it
    #   assumes that you always want to ultimately let the user select a single
    #   item in the tree and have that item's database ID passed back to a
    #   controller in a related form submission.
    #
    #   A value of 0 may indicate that a blank entry is use and has been
    #   selected. See option "<tt>:include_blank</tt>" in helper method
    #   "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree".
    #
    #   An empty string indicates that no nodes were highlighted at all. If you
    #   allow such things you should probably interpret this the same as the
    #   user explicitly selecting a blank entry. It's good to allow both as it
    #   isn't too friendly to assume the user will mean that deselecting all
    #   nodes means "none/blank"; it's good to have an explicit entry for that.
    #   You can still fault a no-selection form submission from the controller
    #   if the target form field value is empty rather than zero, should you
    #   wish to do so.
    #
    # <tt>:target_name_field_id</tt>::
    #   Optional; if included, then when a node is selected, its display text
    #   is written as innerHTML inside the identified element. This lets you
    #   show the user which node was selected by its text, as well as by the
    #   TreeView's own highlight mechanism. This is handy if you're worried
    #   that a selected node in a collapsed branch remains selected, albeit
    #   invisibly - a TreeView implementation quirk, it seems.
    #
    #   If you specify a value for the "<tt>:include_blank</tt>" option in a
    #   call to helper method "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree", then note that
    #   the specified string will be written into the name field if either a
    #   "blank" tree entry item is explicitly selected, or if all items in the
    #   tree are entirely deselected. This goes back to the idea in
    #   "<tt>:target_form_field_id</tt>" above of a zero ID value, or a blank
    #   ID value, being usually treated as the same thing; but again, the
    #   controller can always treat the two conditions as distinct from one
    #   another if it so wishes.
    #
    #
    # == Example
    #
    #   # Location model "acts_as_nested_set"; uses Awesome Nested Set plugin;
    #   # thus has "roots" and "leaf?" methods which act as expected. Location
    #   # objects have a displayable name property in "name".
    #
    #   uses_yui_tree(
    #     { :root_model => Location, :xhr_url_method => :locations_path },
    #     { :only => [ :edit, :update ] }
    #   )
    #
    # This prepares the Controller for a YUI tree using a "Location" model. The
    # tree will obtain new data by a JSON XHR request to the URL returned by a
    # call to "locations_path" with ".js" added as a suffix. Only the ":edit"
    # and ":update" actions can use the tree. Listing both of these actions in
    # the ":only" clause is vital since the Controller's "update" code might
    # re-render the "edit" view (and thus the tree) because of form validation
    # errors. Alternatively use ":exclude" rather than ":only", or omit such a
    # clause altogether to prepare all the controller's views for YUI trees.
    #
    # An XHR URL method of "locations_path" will (assuming sane routes!) lead
    # to an "index" action of a controller for the Location model. The index
    # method must be aware of the YUI tree JSON requests - see
    # "yui_tree_handled_xhr_request?" or use the usual Rails
    # "<tt>respond_to do |format| ... format.js do ...</tt>" construct.
    #
    #   def index
    #     return if yui_tree_handled_xhr_request?( Location );
    #     # ...other processing code...
    #   end
    #
    # A helper method such as "YuiTree::YuiTreeHelper.yui_tree" must be invoked
    # somewhere in the ":edit" action's view (e.g. in "edit.html.erb") so that
    # the tree actually gets built:
    #
    #   <%= hidden_field_tag( 'foo', '[currently selected item ID here]' ) %>
    #   <%= yui_tree( :target_form_field_id => 'foo' ) %>

    # When the tree calls back via AJAX and needs some children to fill in a
    # tree branch, call here to return appropriate data. Pass in the model to
    # find from (e.g. Category, Location - a class, not a string or symbol),
    # then optionally the name of the model instance method used to obtain the
    # text to show for each node (default is "name") and the name of a method
    # used to find out if the item is a leaf (default is "leaf?") - it should
    # return 'true' if so, else 'false'. Models which "act_as_nested_set" using
    # the Awesome Nested Set[http://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set/tree/master]
    # plug-in are compatible with the defaults.
    #
    # If you want the tree order items automatically sorted then add a class
    # method called "apply_default_sort_order" to your model. This is passed an
    # array of model object instances and should sort the array in-place (e.g.
    # with the Array "sort!" method). The method's return value is ignored. If
    # the model has no "apply_default_sort_order" method then the collection
    # retrieved from the database is left in default sort order. If you have
    # simple requirements then using a call to Rails'
    # "default_scope[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002313]"
    # method from your model is the most efficient way to achieve sorted
    # results. For example, in your model issue:
    #
    #   default_scope( -> { order( 'name' => :desc ) } )
    #
    # ...to have all collections of that model returned by finder methods
    # sorted in descending order by a "name" field by default. This applies
    # to _all_ finds done by your application, not just those related to YUI
    # trees, so use the "apply_default_sort_order" approach to restrict the
    # ordering to YUI tree views only.
    #
    # == Example
    #
    # A controller example inside an action which gets invoked when the XHR
    # request comes in:
    #
    #   def action_name
    #     return if yui_tree_handled_xhr_request?( Location, :title, :isLeaf? )
    #     # ...rest of normal action code...
    #   end
    #
    # This would handle YUI tree requests for a Location model using method
    # "title" (rather than the default of "name") to obtain the human-readable
    # names of locations and method "isLeaf?" (rather than the default of
    # "leaf?") to determine whether or not the item is at the end of a branch.
    #
    def yui_tree_handled_xhr_request?
      # This method is generated dynamically at run-time, the dynamic version
      # overwriting this one. The method here exists purely so that the RDoc
      # documentation generator will create documentation for the method.
      # Please see the implementation of "uses_yui_tree" above to see the code
      # for the dynamically generated method.
    end
  end # module ClassMethods

  # Simple helper method which builds an object suitable for rendering as
  # JSON and sending to the YUI tree as node data. Pass an object ID, name
  # to show in the tree and 'true' if this is a leaf, else 'false'. Returns
  # an appropriate Ruby object upon which "to_json" may be called. Call using
  # code such as "YuiTree::make_node_object(...)".
  #
  # The text given in the second parameter is made HTML-safe with "h(...)".
  # The output must be made JS-safe somehow, e.g. by "render :js => <objects>"
  # for one returned object or an array of them in controller handling XHR
  # requests in a "format.js do ..." block or by the necessity of turning the
  # objects into a JS equivalent by calling "to_json", which handles escaping
  # for you.
  #
  # An optional fourth parameter can be given - this is used as an extra class
  # name on the node text. You can specialise individual node appearance with
  # this and CSS, but only if you make custom nodes externally. If you use the

    # * <tt>:root_title_method</tt> (perhaps, if using <tt>:root_model</tt>)
    # * <tt>:root_collection</tt> - if your model does *not* match the
    #   characteristics described for option "<tt>:root_model</tt>" in the
    #   "YuiTree::ClassMethods.uses_yui_tree" method documentation, then you
    #   must provide an array of objects defining the roots of the tree.
    #   Construct array entries by calling "YuiTree::make_node_object". The
    #   resulting collection is later turned into a JavaScript-safe array by
    #   a wider call to "to_json" on a JavaScript options hash which gets
    #   created by the YUI tree instantiation helper code; you don't need
    #   to worry about HTML or JavaScript escaping of any values yourself.
    #
    # The following option values can be specified technically in any of the
    # locations described by the documentation for the
    # "YuiTree::ClassMethods.uses_yui_tree" method, but it is very uncommon
    # to use them anywhere other than a call here, to "yui_tree". Each of the
    # items is optional and modifies tree behaviour in some way. Some of the
    # options work together, so use of one may mean you must also use another.
    # Any such relationships are described below:
    #
    # <tt>:include_blank</tt>::
    #   A string if you want that string to be included at the top of the roots
    #   of the tree as an item that indicates nothing/none/blank - an ID of
    #   zero is associated with it. This option works whether you use the
    #   plugin's generation of the root dataset via "<tt>:root_model</tt>" or
    #   if you generate your own dataset and provide it through
    #   "<tt>:root_collection</tt>". Of course, you can always add your own
    #   blank entry/entries in the latter case, but using the
    #   "<tt>:include_blank</tt>" might be more convenient and keep your code
    #   clean.
    #
    #   The reason you pass a string rather than, say, a boolean is so that you
    #   can pass any relevant message, including one looked up from an
    #   internationalisation locale file (assuming Rails >= 2.3.x).
    #
    #   Note that this string is used if a nodes is deselected so that no nodes
    #   are highlighted and the "<tt>:target_name_field_id</tt>" option has
    #   been set up - the string is written as innerHTML of the name field.
    #
    # <tt>:exclude</tt>::
    #   An ID as an integer, or an object with a method 'id' which returns its
    #   ID as an integer, or an array of either of these types (they can be
    #   mixed in the same array). Specifies items which will not be included
    #   in the tree even if the Controller returns them at any point. This
    #   works at the node addition level in JS, so it is *not a security
    #   feature*. If you don't want something to be seen by a user, don't let
    #   the Controller send it out in the first place. The exclusion feature is
    #   useful if using, say, a tree to assign a parent to an existing item
    #   within a hierarchy - you don't want to let the user try and assign the
    #   item _itself_ as a parent, so exclude it.
    #
    #   If you exclude a non-leaf item, it will be shown in the tree but will
    #   not be selectable. This way, children can still be selected. At
    #   present the code is "sort of" clever enough to know if no children
    #   are going to be present due to exclusions, in that it will try to
    #   fetch child nodes but when they all get excluded the Yahoo tree view
    #   itself will stop trying further and change the node indicator on the
    #   parent to being a branch, rather than a toggle control. It does mean
    #   one technically unnecessary AJAX request and associated UI update
    #   delay though, but it's a much simpler mechanism than trying to work
    #   such things out up-front.
    #
    # <tt>:expand</tt>::
    #   As "<tt>:exclude</tt>", but specifies nodes which will be automatically
    #   expanded whenever they are added to the tree. Node that if you add a
    #   non-root node to the exclusions list, you must also add any if its
    #   parents (i.e. its complete set of ancestors) back to the root if you
    #   want that whole branch to be expanded automatically. Otherwise the
    #   branch starting from the child will only automatically expand if the
    #   user expands the parent node which contains it.
    #
    # <tt>:highlight</tt>::
    #   As "<tt>:exclude</tt>" but only takes a single item not an array;
    #   specifies an item to be highlighted when the tree is created. Once
    #   highlighted initially, the item is forgotten and will not be
    #   auto-highlighted again. If a non-root item then it will only be
    #   highlighted when the branch containing it is opened; in general you
    #   will probably want to use the "<tt>:expand</tt>" option in cojunction
    #   with "<tt>:highlight</tt>" for non-root nodes.
    #
    # <tt>:multiple</tt>::
    #   A boolean (defaults to '<tt>false</tt>') which says that multiple
    #   items may be selected in the tree. See below for more.
    #
    # <tt>:form_leaf_nodes_only</tt>::
    #   If '<tt>true</tt>', only the IDs of _leaf_ nodes will be written into
    #   the form field identified by the mandatory
    #   "<tt>:target_form_field_id</tt>" option. Defaults to '<tt>false</tt>'
    #   so that any selected (highlighted) node is included, leaf or otherwise.
    #
    # <tt>:data_for_xhr_call</tt>::
    #   An optional string which if included will be added to the parameters
    #   used when the XHR call to retrieve more node items is made. If using
    #   the built-in "YuiTree::ClassMethods.yui_tree_handled_xhr_request?"
    #   method then this is of no use, but if you write a custom handler then
    #   the data string provides a crude but effective way of passing in
    #   external data. Usually, the data is used as some kind of filter,
    #   restricting the range of nodes which the XHR handler method would
    #   otherwise have returned. Note that the string will be run through the
    #   'j' helper to make it JS-safe, so some characters may not be treated
    #   quite how you expect - avoid literal single quotes, double quotes and
    #   backslashes in particular. The string will appear in the params hash
    #   under the key "<tt>:data</tt>". An empty string given here is treated
    #   the same way as if the option had been completely omitted.
    #
    # The options hash *must not* contain any of the following keys since this
    # would interfere with values set for those same options elsewhere and
    # provoke undefined behaviour (one part of your view would disagree with
    # another part of your view). If present, these keys will be deleted.
    #
    # - <tt>:body_class</tt>
    #
    # Any other YUI tree options not listed above are irrelevant here.
    #
    # Note that you must *never mix* the use of options "<tt>:root_model</tt>"
    # and "<tt>:root_collection</tt>" between this call and any other places
    # where options may be specified; if you do, results will be undefined.
    #
    #
    # == Multiple selection trees
    #
    # If '<tt>:multiple</tt>' is '<tt>true</tt>' the tree allows multiple check
    # boxes to be selected. Selecting a child does not cause its parents to
    # change state by default - the user is free to choose any collection of
    # nodes without constraint - but that can be changed with options listed
    # below.
    #
    # Option key "<tt>:highlight</tt>" now begins to work as "<tt>:expand</tt>"
    # or "<tt>:exclude</tt>" in that it can take a single item or an array of
    # items to be highlighted. If you use "<tt>:expand</tt>" to auto-expand
    # highlighted nodes, remember that you need to specify all ancestors of any
    # non-root node you want expanded.
    #
    # The form field specified in "<tt>:target_form_field_id</tt>" has its
    # value populated using a comma-separated list of IDs of selected items.
    # The container specified in "<tt>:target_name_field_id</tt>", if any, will
    # have its value populated using a space-separated list of names of
    # selected items. You can customise this list of names with the following
    # extra options only relevant to multiple selection trees using
    # "<tt>:target_name_field_id</tt>":
    #
    # <tt>:name_field_separator</tt>::
    #   Text to use as a separator between items in the name field. Defaults
    #   to a single space. Must be JS single quoted string safe. May be HTML
    #   (e.g. "<br />").
    #
    # <tt>:name_include_parents</tt>::
    #   If you want to include the names of all parent nodes whenever a node's
    #   label is used for the name field so that each text entry reflects the
    #   whole of the branch of the tree used to reach the node in question,
    #   then set this option to a string which is used as a separator between
    #   each of the parent items. Must be JS single quoted string safe. May be
    #   HTML or even an empty string to directly concatenate parent names. By
    #   default names of parents are not included - only the label of the
    #   individual node is added to the name field.
    #
    # <tt>:name_leaf_nodes_only</tt>::
    #   If '<tt>true</tt>', use only labels of leaf nodes for name field text;
    #   don't include others. Useful in conjunction with the
    #   "<tt>:name_include_parents</tt>" option, since when the latter is in
    #   use, individual entries in the name field will already indicate the
    #   labels for the complete branch leading to a node so including names of
    #   non-leaf items would only lead to duplication. By default names of all
    #   nodes are included.
    #
    # Once multiple items are selectable, it becomes desirable to be able to
    # control the YUI tree's highlight propagation features - that is, when a
    # node is selected, should its parent and/or child nodes be automatically
    # selected as well? The following options control this behaviour. The
    # settings apply to every node in the tree.
    #
    # <tt>:propagate_up</tt>::
    #   If '<tt>true</tt>', selecting any node causes all parent nodes on the
    #   same branch to be selected, if any. By default this option is disabled.
    #
    # <tt>:propagate_down</tt>::
    #   If '<tt>true</tt>', selecting any node causes all child nodes in the
    #   tree below this node, if any, to be selected. By default this option
    #   is disabled.
